### BookWorm Library Web Application Backend

#### Java Spring Boot REST API 

This is a toy app I once made in my free time. Application is dockerized - use `build_and_run.sh` to build and start backend and postgres containers.

Go to [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) to see API documentation.

Karate tests works with Java 8 only.
